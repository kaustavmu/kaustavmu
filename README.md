Hello! I'm Kaustav Mukherjee, a year 2 mechanical engineering undergraduate at NUS, with a second major in innovation and design and a specialisation in aeronautics. Though my interests lay firmly in my primary major, I believe that interdisciplinary knowledge is not only useful but crucial to being an effective engineer in today's landscape. Hence, welcome to my github, containing the code for all the various programming projects that I have undertaken.
